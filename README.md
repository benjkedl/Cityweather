# Cityweather

As initially thought, the data does support that temperatures rise as you approach the equator (0 lattitude), but it is not as simple as that.  It appears that the highest temperatures are centered around 25 Lattitude.  This could be because of the tilt of the earths rotation on its axis.
There was no noticable pattern to the humidity differences across the world in terms of lattitude.
Wind speed also did not appear to change as a result of lattitude across the earth, and neither did cloudiness.

A large caveat to all of this data is that it was taken at one specific moment in time, not the max values for these cities.  For some cities, when the data was taken it was day time, and for some it was night time, so to get a truer picture of the data you would need to capture the values as a maximums of each data type for a specific day of the year.  

I did not include the API key to openweathermapy in this code.  you will need to copy and paste your own into the apy_keys.py file
